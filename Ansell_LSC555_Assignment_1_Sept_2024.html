<h2 style="color:red;">Context</h2>
  <p>The King County Library System serves the Seattle regional area in Washington State. </p>
<p>Voters established its predecessor organization, the King County Rural Library District, in 1942, serving the community through rural outreach and two small community libraries.  KCLS launched its website in 1994.</p>
<p>
<h2 style="color:red;">Users</h2>

<p>The KCLS website provides information for difference types of users, depending on the category:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Catalog: advanced search provides filter options for adults, children and teens</li>
  <li>Books and More: includes a personalized recommendation form</li>
  <li>Calendar: filters for events relevant to adults, kids, older adults, teens and tweens</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:red;">Content</h2>

<p>KCLS is a full-service virtual library. Users can apply for a library card, ask questions or get help, access research services and event information, and check out a variety of materials. Physical  materials can be checked out for in-person pick-up by location, whereas digital materials can be downloaded or accessed online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audiobooks and downloadable audiobooks</li>
  <li>Books and Kindle/Overdrive/Libby downloadable books</li>
  <li>DVDs and streaming video</li>
  <li>Newspapers, Magazines, maps, and music</li>
  <li>Easy reader and large print titles</li>
  <li>Website and online data sources</li>	
</ul>

<h2 style="color:red;">Observations & Unique Features</h2>

<p>I have had the pleasure of utilizing KCLS online since 2019. My brother and sister-in-law live in Bellevue, Washington, and kindly added me to their KCLS account because I was living in Kenya and did not have access to a comprehensive library. I have downloaded dozens of books and audiobooks from KCLS since 2019.</p>One of the aspects of KCLS that I really appreciate is the reader recommendations and comments feature. For most materials, readers can give up to 5 stars and leave comments. This has helped me to choose materials that are highly rated.</p> <p>Additionally, librarians provide recommended reading lists by category and so if you are considering whether to read Frank Herbert's Dune before seeing the movies, other readers have left relevant comments and Dune also appears on some recommended reading lists for science fiction or books that were adapted to film.</p>

<h3 style="color:red;">Recommendations</h3>

<p>The KCLS website seems very user-friendly to me, but I would be interested to know what feedback they've had about its accessibility. The top menu navigation is straightforward, but the audience filters vary by topic (calendar events can be sorted for "teens" and "tweens", "adults" and "older adults," but the advanced search function for catalog items provides only "teen" and "adult" filters). I have not subscribed to the library's newsletter, nor do I follow them on social media.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, I would be interested to speak to a KCLS librarian about the following possible recommendations, to learn more:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>How accessible is the website for the visually impaired?</li>
  <li>Why are the audience filters different for events and the catalog?</li>
  <li>What is KCLS's following on social media channels?</li>
<li>Does KCLS segment content by audience for different channels?</li>
</ol>
